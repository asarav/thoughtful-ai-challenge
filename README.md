Warehouse Sorting Script

** How to Run
# 0. Ensure python (3) is installed. No packages need to be pip installed since this uses standard libraries.

1. Grab the code (clone or download)
$ git clone <repo-url>

2. Run the built‑in tests
$ python challenge.py

** Using It in Your Own Code
from sort_packages import sort

stack = sort(120, 80, 60, 18)

The script is also its own test suite—run it directly and it executes unittest cases that exercise all edge conditions.
